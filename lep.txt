Autotools Leptonica
If they are not already installed, you need the following libraries (Ubuntu 16.04/14.04):
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
sudo apt-get install autoconf-archive
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
if you plan to install the training tools, you also need the following libraries:
sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
sudo apt-get install libpango1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
You also need to install Leptonica.
One option is to install the distro's Leptonica package:
sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev
but if you are using an oldish version of Linux, the Leptonica version may be too old, so you will need to build from source.
Tesseract versions and the minimum version of Leptonica required:
Tesseract	Leptonica	Ubuntu
4.00	1.74.0	Must build from source
3.04	1.71	Ubuntu 16.043.03	1.70	Ubuntu 14.043.02	1.69	Ubuntu 12.043.01	1.67	
The sources are at http://www.leptonica.org/. The instructions at Leptonica README are clear, but basically it is as described in Compilation below.
Ensure that the development headers for Leptonica are installed before compiling Tesseract. Note that if building Leptonica from source, you may need to ensure that /usr/local/lib is in your library path. This is a standard Linux bug, and the information at Stackoverflow is very helpful.
Compilation
Tesseract uses a standard autotools based build system, so the compilation process should be familiar.
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git
cd tesseract
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
If configure fails with an error like "syntax error near unexpected token `-mavx,'" and/or AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG(...) then double check you have installed autoconf-archive.
If configure fails with such error "configure: error: Leptonica 1.74 or higher is required. Try to install libleptonica-dev package." and you are sure you have installed leptonica (for example in /usr/local) then probably pkg-config is not looking at your install folder (check with "pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config"). A solution is to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH : example :PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=/usr/local/include ./configure --with-extra-includes=/usr/local/include --with-extra-libraries=/usr/local/lib
Since we have to compile leptonica to use version 1.74, we should use LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" make instead of make for Tesseract.
安装version 1.74 的坑。直接用：
sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev 
安装的是1.73版本，而且不能够升级到更高版本，于是只有直接下载编译了。下载地址：

下载下来后编译安装：
(2) Using autoconf (supported by James Le Cuirot).
        Run ./configure in this directory to
        build Makefiles here and in src.  Autoconf handles the
        following automatically:
            * architecture endianness
            * enabling Leptonica I/O image read/write functions that
              depend on external libraries (if the libraries exist)
            * enabling functions for redirecting formatted image stream
              I/O to memory (on Linux only)
        After running ./configure: make; make install.  There's also
        a 'make check' for testing.

其中可能会缺其他的依赖库，一一安装解决。
